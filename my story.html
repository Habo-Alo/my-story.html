             <h1>this is my developer story</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>When I was in high school, I always wanted to be a teacher.</li>
        <li>When I started to go to college, I started to use computers and the internet more in my daily life.</li>
        <li>Then, I wanted to learn how computers, softwares, and web pages work. </li>
        <li>That is what motivated me to study computer information systems in college, and start looking for a source that teaches me how to code.</li>
        <li>I figured out that I enjoy doing hands- on projects and learning while applying my learning rather than just keep reading and watching videos.</li>
        <li>With Refcode, I will learn how to build my first website, and know how to code, which for me is the most valuable experience that I will gain.<li>
